                    that person is Mafia or not. thus their goal is to help the citizens vote correctly in
                    who to eliminate during the day. They generally want to keep their identity secret so
                    that the Mafia cannot eliminate them early.

                <p style="text-align: justify">
                    To use the bot must first add it to your group chat. To do this use <a
                        href="https://telegram.me/mafiagbot?startgroup=0">this link</a><br/>You can start the game with
                    the <a href="#start">start command</a> in a group chat. after entering /start bot will ask you about
                    game configuration<br/>When the bot says the game has started all players need to sign up
                    using the keyboard button register provided by bot to the users.<br/>When all players have signed
                    up,
                    the game starts automatically in day mode.
                    At the beginning of the game the bot sends everyone private messages telling them their roles.
                    It's also tells members of mafia the names of other mafia members. So all mafia members know
                    each other. At this point if the mafia are more than 2 people, they should create a new group
                    and add the bot to it.
                    During the day every user, can start a election using the <a href="#startElection">election
                    command</a> however this type of election has no influence on the game and it is merely for
                    information and continued discussion. After the election has started bot create new keyboard with
                    the
                    name of the players for everyone, so players can vote each other and in the end they should click on
                    done button. Voting finishes when everyone has voted, then the results are
                    announced. Those with more votes should defend their case. You can do as many elections as you
                    want but in the end a <a href="#startFinalElection">final election</a> should be done and the
                    one with the most votes will be killed.
                    When someone is killed during the day, the Night comes. Now it's mafia’s turn. The Mafia discuss
                    among themselves in their own group and then kill someone with the kill button provided by bot to
                    them
                    After the user is killed by Mafia it's the detectives’ turn. The bot will privately ask the
                    detective whom he/she suspects, and then the detective enter the suspect's name using the keyboard
                    provided by bot. The bot will then let him know if the suspect is Mafia or not.
                    After mafia and detective, it is now the Doctor’s turn. Doctor can heal one player per night.
                    The Bot will privately ask the doctor to name someone to rescue. Doctor has to rescue a player by
                    selecting his/her name on the keyboard which bot provided.
                    After doctor’s heal, it will be day again and the Bot will announce the killed player in the
                    game’s public group chat. The game will continue its routine until whether all the mafia players
                    being killed or the number of citizens equals the number of mafias.

                    <dt>Does Mafia kills anyone on the first night?</dt>
                    <dd>No. The game starts with Day! As the bot announces the roles in a private chat to players
                        and mafias to other mafia players, the first Night does not exists. It means that neither
                        Mafia kills anyone nor detective asks about anyone or doctor heals anyone.
                    </dd>
                    <dt>Can someone vote to several people during a day?</dt>
                    <dd>Yes. you can select several player when bot ask to vote and after that you click on done button
                    </dd>
                    <dt>Can someone vote for nobody?</dt>
                    <dd>Yes, without selecting player just click on Done button.
                    </dd>
                </dl>
                <dl>
                    <dt>Can someone play in several games simultaneously?</dt>
                    <dd>No. In this case the bot can not recognize which game are the private messages are for.
                        That’s why the bot does not register the user on the second game unless he leaves the
                        current game with <a href="#killme">kill me command</a>.
                    </dd>
                    <dt>Does the bot announces identity of killed person?</dt>
                    <dd>No. To keep the game more exciting, the bot does not do that.</dd>
                    <dt>Does the bot have access to all the messages in the group?</dt>
                    <dd>No. the Bot is added to groups in “Privacy Mode” and just have access to messages starting
                        with “/” character or reply to bot itself. For more information on this subject please visit
